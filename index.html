    <h1>Corners</h1>
    <h2>A game for 2 players</h2>
    <p>
      Need-2 different colored pencils or markers. Both players start in
      opposite corners. Players take turns at coloring a block of 2 squares.
      Every block that you color after the first one must join to one of your
      other colored blocks, but only at the corner. A player cannot have 2 of
      their colored blocks joined side by side. When a player has nowhere to go,
      he is out and the other player is the winner. An example of a game is
      shown. Grey is the winner as black cannot make another move.
